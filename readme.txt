Use jQuery Vertical Scroller plugin to display posts as a vertical scroll in a widget, post or page. Supports multiple instances.

== Description ==

jQuery Vertical Scroller plugin is our attempt to create a easy to use widget for adding vertical scrolling to your wordpress site. With version 2.0 we are extending the ability to scroll in a page or post. 

You can scroll anything from your recent posts to custom posts you might have created for other plugins. The scroll is flexible to allow you to scroll in 2 vertical directions. Top-to-Bottom or Bottom-to-Top.

= Do you need more than one scroller? =
No problem with this plug-in. All you need to do is drag-&-drop another copy of the scroller into your widget area and set it up. No need to leave the widgets screen.
